#  Linen&Towels Calculator  üìç

This application was created with the objective of maximizing efficiency in my former workplace, where I was delivering material used to make hotel room beds.

It was made entirely by myself in the Unity video game engine, which at that time was one of the technologies I used the most, so for convenience I decided to try its development in this environment.

It is fully functional with only one feature that was not developed.
